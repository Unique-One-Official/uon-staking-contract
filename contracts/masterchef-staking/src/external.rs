/// external contract calls
/* 
These functions are used to call outer side contract functions like NFT contract and FT contract
so if you want to just transfer nft you can use "nft_transfer"
or if you want to transfer nft with payment you can use "nft_transfer_payout". this will return the required payout amount send to the prev owner and also NFT creators(belong to royalty)
"ft_transfer" is used for transfering FT tokens.
Not for transfer $Near.
